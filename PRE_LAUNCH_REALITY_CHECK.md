## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOR TODAY LAUNCH

### 1. User Expectation Mismatch
**Problem**: If you market as "TRO packet assistant," users expect:
- Complete packet (5-8 forms)
- Step-by-step guidance
- Ready-to-file output

**Reality**: You only deliver FL-320 (1 of 5 forms)

**Risk**: 
- User frustration and negative reviews
- "This doesn't help me at all" feedback
- Refund requests / chargebacks
- Damage to brand reputation

### 2. Incomplete Workflow
**Problem**: Users filling out FL-320 alone is rarely useful because:
- FL-320 is a RESPONSE form (used when other party already filed)
- Primary TRO form is DV-100 (initiating form)
- FL-320 without DV-100 is like having a reply email without the original

**Reality**: Wrong starting point for most users

### 3. Legal Liability
**Problem**: Incomplete packets can result in:
- Rejected filings (clerk won't accept)
- Missed court dates (incorrect forms)
- Lost legal protection (TRO not granted)
- Potential harm if DV situation not addressed

**Risk**: Users may blame SwiftFill for failed filings

### 4. E-Filing Claims
**Problem**: You mentioned "ready to e-file"

**Reality**: 
- No EFSP integration
- No merged PDF generation
- No electronic signature
- Users would need manual intervention anyway

## 🚨 BLOCKERS IF YOU INSIST ON SHIPPING TODAY AS "TRO PACKET TOOL"

If you want to market as "complete TRO packet assistant" TODAY, you MUST:

1. ❌ Build DV-100 form (1 week minimum)
2. ❌ Build workflow to connect DV-100 → FL-320 (3 days)
3. ❌ Build packet assembly (3 days)
4. ❌ User test with real case (2 days)

**Minimum viable TRO packet**: 10-12 days of focused development

**You cannot ship a "TRO packet tool" today without misleading users.**

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

**What I recommend you do RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Pause** - Don't deploy as "TRO packet tool" today
2. **Decide** - Choose Option 3 (Soft Launch Beta)
3. **Update** - Change marketing to "Beta v0.1 - FL-320 form"
4. **Deploy** - Launch honest beta with waitlist TODAY
5. **Build** - Develop complete packet over next 8-10 weeks
6. **Launch** - Full launch Q1 2026 with complete product

**You can ship SOMETHING today** (beta version of FL-320 tool), but not the complete TRO packet system you envision.

**The choice is yours**: 
- Ship incomplete product with misleading marketing (risky)
- Ship honest beta and build toward vision (smart)
- Wait 2-3 months and launch complete product (safest)

---

**My vote**: Option 3 (Beta + Waitlist). Ship today, but be honest about what you're shipping.

**Last Updated**: November 16, 2025  
**Decision Required**: Before deployment
