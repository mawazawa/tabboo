- **80% self-represented** by time of judgment
- LA courts grant **thousands of restraining orders yearly**

4. **Fear of Reporting** - Immigration status concerns, community distrust of police

**2025 Improvement**: New digital communication system automatically notifies LASD, LAPD, and 86 other agencies when firearm relinquishment orders are violated.
