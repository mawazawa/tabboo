# Web Agent Protocol: DVRO Field Mapping (Autopilot Mode)

**Objective**: Map all form fields for DV-100 and DV-105 using the new "Glass Layer" Field Mapper tool.

**Target Forms**:
1.  **DV-100**: Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order (13 pages, 837 fields)
2.  **DV-105**: Request for Child Custody and Visitation Orders (6 pages, 466 fields)

## Prerequisites
- Access to the SwiftFill application running locally or in a dev environment.
- "Auto-Pilot" mode enabled in the FormViewer.

## Instructions for Agents

### 1. Initialization
1.  Navigate to the form URL (e.g., `/edit/DV-100` or `/edit/DV-105`).
2.  Toggle "Edit Mode" (Press `E`).
3.  Click "Enable Auto-Pilot" in the mapping HUD.

### 2. Mapping Workflow (The "Glass Layer" Protocol)
The system will highlight the next unmapped field from the Figma import. Your job is to verify and refine:

1.  **Visual Scan**: Look for the neon orange scanning rectangle.
2.  **Verification**:
    *   Does the rectangle align with the PDF field?
    *   Is the field type correct (Input vs. Checkbox vs. Textarea)?
3.  **Correction (if needed)**:
    *   **Move**: Click and drag to position perfectly.
    *   **Resize**: Drag corners to fit the visual boundaries.
    *   **Keyboard Nudge**: Use Arrow keys for pixel-perfect alignment.
4.  **Confirmation**:
    *   Press `Enter` to save and advance to the next field.
    *   Press `Skip` (or `Tab`) only if the field is not a real input.

### 3. Field Naming Convention (Reference)
*   **Checkboxes**: `item[Number][Letter]` (e.g., `item1a`, `item5c_1`)
*   **Inputs**: `[section]_[description]` (e.g., `petitioner_firstName`, `hearing_date`)
*   **Textareas**: `desc_[topic]` (e.g., `desc_abuseDetails`)

### 4. Quality Standards
*   **Alignment**: Field edges must be inside the visual box stroke.
*   **Grouping**: Radio button groups must share the same base name.
*   **Meta-Data**: Ensure `isRequired` is checked for mandatory court fields.

## Reporting
*   Log progress in Linear under project `JusticeOS`.
*   Report any "unmappable" fields or PDF rendering artifacts.
